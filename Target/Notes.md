## ðŸŽ¯ Main Goals in 1 Month

1. **Brush up core MERN technical skills** â€” so you can answer *theory + practical coding* questions confidently.
2. **Master interview patterns** â€” HR + technical + system design + project explanation.
3. **Build/revise 1-2 strong showcase projects** â€” to demonstrate practical skills.
4. **Practice coding & problem-solving daily** â€” for confidence in live coding rounds.
5. **Learn how to tell your story** â€” so you stand out as an experienced MERN trainer moving into a developer role.

## ðŸ“… 4-Week Plan

### **Week 1 â€“ Foundation Refresh (Theory + Hands-on)**

**Goal:** Refresh all MERN fundamentals + start light coding practice.

**Topics to Revise:**

* **JavaScript (Deep)**: ES6+, closures, promises, async/await, event loop, `this`, prototype, array & object methods, error handling.
* **ReactJS**: Components, props/state, hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useReducer`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`), conditional rendering, list rendering, form handling, API calls, lifting state, prop drilling, controlled/uncontrolled components.
* **Node.js**: Modules, event-driven architecture, Express basics, middleware, error handling, file handling, environment variables.
* **MongoDB**: CRUD, indexes, aggregation, schema design (even if using Mongoose), relations (`$lookup`), best practices.
* **Git**: Branching, merging, pull requests.

**Practice:**

* Daily **30â€“45 min coding practice** (LeetCode / CodeStudio / HackerRank) â†’ focus on arrays, strings, objects, basic algorithms.
* Build **one small React app** this week (e.g., ToDo + API integration).

---

### **Week 2 â€“ Advanced MERN + APIs**

**Goal:** Strengthen backend + full-stack integration skills.

**Topics to Revise:**

* **Express Advanced**: Routing, middleware chaining, authentication flows.
* **JWT Auth**: Access tokens, refresh tokens.
* **REST APIs**: Designing clean APIs, validation, pagination, filtering, rate limiting.
* **MongoDB Advanced**: Aggregation pipelines, performance optimization.
* **Deployment Basics**: Heroku, Render, Vercel, or Railway.

**Practice:**

* Build a **full-stack mini project**:

  * Auth (login/register)
  * CRUD with MongoDB
  * Deployment online
* Daily **coding practice** on algorithms (sorting, searching, hashmaps, recursion basics).

---

### **Week 3 â€“ Interview Simulation + Projects**

**Goal:** Prepare real interview scenarios & projects.

**Topics to Focus:**

* **System Design (Small Scale)**:

  * How would you design a blog system?
  * How would you design an e-commerce cart?
  * How would you handle file uploads?
  * Basic scaling ideas (caching, pagination).
* **Behavioral Questions**: Tell me about yourself, biggest challenge, team conflict, why leaving current job.
* **Common MERN Interview Questions**:

  * Explain event loop in Node.js.
  * How to prevent XSS/CSRF in MERN apps.
  * Difference between `useMemo` and `useCallback`.
  * How to optimize React performance.

**Practice:**

* **Mock interviews** (with peers or online platforms).
* Refactor one old project to improve code quality & documentation.
* Practice explaining your project architecture on a whiteboard.

---

### **Week 4 â€“ Final Polishing & Confidence Boost**

**Goal:** Final review + presentation skills + mock interviews.

**Focus:**

* **Revise all weak areas** from past 3 weeks.
* **Practice live coding** (screen share & explain while coding).
* **Create concise project pitch**:

  * Problem solved
  * Tech used
  * Challenges & solutions
* **Update resume & LinkedIn** with:

  * MERN projects
  * Achievements at Red & White

**Practice:**

* **Daily 1â€“2 mock interview questions**.
* **Daily 1 coding challenge**.
* Re-deploy & test your projects so they run smoothly.
